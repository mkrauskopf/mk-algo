A set of algorithms which I've decided to implement for some reason and which could be possibly useful for others to
look at.

So far only Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) is implemented with [naive](src/main/java/mk/tsp/NaiveTsp.java) and
[Help-Karp](src/main/java/mk/tsp/HeldKarpTsp.java) algorithms. Since I encountered their possible need in the
[Devstronomy](https://github.com/mkrauskopf/devstronomy/) project.
